Certainly! Let's break down the code line by line:

1. `import pandas as pd`: Imports the Pandas library and assigns it the alias `pd`.

2. `from IPython.display import display`: Imports the `display` function from the IPython.display module. This function allows you to display the contents of Pandas DataFrames more nicely in Jupyter notebooks or IPython environments.

3. `red_wine = pd.read_csv('/content/red-wine - red-wine.csv')`: Reads a CSV file named "red-wine - red-wine.csv" located at the specified path and stores it as a DataFrame named `red_wine`.

4. `df_train = red_wine.sample(frac=0.7, random_state=0)`: Randomly samples 70% of the rows from the `red_wine` DataFrame and stores them in `df_train`.

5. `df_valid = red_wine.drop(df_train.index)`: Drops the rows that are already selected for `df_train` from the `red_wine` DataFrame and stores the remaining rows in `df_valid`. This is essentially splitting the dataset into a training set (`df_train`) and a validation set (`df_valid`).

6. `display(df_train.head(4))`: Displays the first 4 rows of the `df_train` DataFrame.

7. `max_ = df_train.max(axis=0)`: Calculates the maximum value for each column in the `df_train` DataFrame.

8. `min_ = df_train.min(axis=0)`: Calculates the minimum value for each column in the `df_train` DataFrame.

9. `df_train = (df_train - min_) / (max_ - min_)`: Scales the values in the `df_train` DataFrame to the range [0, 1] using min-max scaling.

10. `df_valid = (df_valid - min_) / (max_ - min_)`: Scales the values in the `df_valid` DataFrame similarly to the training set.

11. `X_train = df_train.drop('quality', axis=1)`: Creates the feature matrix `X_train` by dropping the 'quality' column from the `df_train` DataFrame.

12. `X_valid = df_valid.drop('quality', axis=1)`: Creates the feature matrix `X_valid` for the validation set similarly to the training set.

13. `y_train = df_train['quality']`: Creates the target vector `y_train` containing only the 'quality' column from the `df_train` DataFrame.

14. `y_valid = df_valid['quality']`: Creates the target vector `y_valid` for the validation set similarly to the training set.

15. `print(X_train.shape)`: Prints the shape of the feature matrix `X_train`.

16. `from tensorflow import keras`: Imports the Keras module from TensorFlow.

17. `from tensorflow.keras import layers`: Imports the `layers` module from Keras.

18. `model = keras.Sequential([...])`: Defines a sequential model using Keras. It consists of four densely connected layers with 512 units each and ReLU activation function, except for the last layer which has 1 unit (for regression).

19. `model.compile(...)`: Compiles the model with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer and mean squared error (MSE) loss function.

20. `history = model.fit(...)`: Trains the model using the training data (`X_train` and `y_train`) for 100 epochs, with a batch size of 256, and using the validation data (`X_valid` and `y_valid`) for validation during training.

21. `history_df = pd.DataFrame(history.history)`: Creates a DataFrame containing the training history of the model.

22. `history_df['loss'].plot()`: Plots the training loss over epochs using Matplotlib.
